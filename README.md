# HuntFell

## By Stopped Clock Studios

HuntFell is an isometric action-adventure about slaying your way through an abandoned manor to uncover its secrets. Explore the darkness using elemental weapons and piece together the truth behind the fell beasts that remain.

As a novice monster hunter you’ll explore the manor, fight monsters, read journal entries left behind by the manor’s former inhabitants, and equip special elemental modifiers to your weapons that will aid you in solving puzzles in the environment and fighting special enemies. The story will be revealed, and you’ll have to reckon with its fatal consequences in a climactic encounter.

HuntFell is available for download at [stoppedlock.itch.io/huntfell]. Feel free to leave a comment there, we'd love to hear your feedback! :)
